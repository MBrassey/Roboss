#### What it does:

    function awake() {
    
    ... Sends signal to Roblox ensuring your character does not sleep ... 
    ... Avoids detection algorithms by randomizing the delay between awake signals ...
    
    } 

    function sayings() {
    
    ... Engages the Roblox window and automatically types a wise message from time to time ...
    ... Avoids detection algorithms by randomizing the delay between sayings ... 
    ... Respectfully stops speaking after 200 cycles and re-activates the speaking button ... 
    
    }

    function dance() {
    
    ... Makes Roblox character dance, if dancing is interrupted, it will begin again at a randomized interval ...
    ... Continues dancing until the StopFunc() is evoked via the "Stop" button ... 
    
    }

    function record() {
    
    ... Starts recording the active Roblox window ...
    ... Stops recording the active Roblox window, Roblox saves the video to default location ...
    
    }

#### What Roblox games does it work on?
Roboss works on all Roblox games. It works especially well for games that require your active participation to stay awake.  

#### How to use it?
Click any options you desire on the left, then click "Start" on the right to activate Roboss. When you would like to stop, click "Stop" on the right. You can add optons anytime even if Roboss is already running, however, you cannot stop individual options without clicking "Stop" and stopping all the options first. 

#### How long will my character stay awake?
Roboss will keep your character awake as long as possible. Roboss also prevents network disconnection due to inactivity. If the Roblox server is updated or you have a physical or ISP related network disconnection, Roboss will stop working.  


#### How much MeepCity Coin can I earn with Roboss?
Based on recent testing, Roboss deliveres around 20,000 Meep Coin per day to PLUS Members.  


#### Will my account get banned?
No. Roboss uses methods to produce organic like activity simulating a real human being. It is completely undetectable.


#### Is Roboss Free?
Roboss is 100% Free & Open Source. If you find Roboss useful please clicking the donate button above ^__^.   


#### Why did I make Roboss?
I made Roboss for fun, specifically for use in MeepCity.  


#### How many Robux can you save by using Roboss?
In MeepCity, Roboss earns you $3,000 Robux worth of MeepCoin, this is $35 value per day!  


#### Troubleshooting:
If you are already dancing, you have to select the dance option to continue staying awake (in some minigames).
Roboss will continually activate the Roblox window, so you will not be able to have a window on top of Roblox.
You can use a second monitor with Roboss and Roblox open so you can continue using your computer normally on the other. When using the "Speak Wisely" function, if you click on another window at the same time as Roboss is trying to type the message in to Roblox, the text will instead be printed on the window you clicked. 


#### ToDo:
- [ ] Its done BRUH.
