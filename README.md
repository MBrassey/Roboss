    function awake() {
    
    ... Sends signal to Roblox ensuring your character does not sleep ... 
    ... Avoids detection algorithms by randomizing the delay between awake signals ...
    
    } 

    function sayings() {
    
    ... Engages the Roblox window and automatically types a wise message from time to time ...
    ... Avoids detection algorithms by randomizing the delay between sayings ...
